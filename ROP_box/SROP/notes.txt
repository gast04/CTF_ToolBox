Can be useful during ROP if there are no good gadgets to set
a register. 
Using SROP we have to set all registers, but we also have 
to set the Stack Pointer and Instruction Pointer for example, 
so this stuff has to match.

the stack is only important if you need further parameters from it, 
but it should be enough calling sys_exec ;)
