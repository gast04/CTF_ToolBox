vsyscall:
  if a binary is PIE, it is possible that there is a Region
  which is always mapped the same. this is vsyscall.

  This was an old speed up idea for executing syscalls in 
  userspace to make it faster, but from the security view
  this is a problem, because it is a gadget we can use at
  a fixed address.

  in r2 just look at the memory maps -> dm (dm?)

        ;-- map._vsyscall_._r_x:                       
        0xffffffffff600000      48c7c0600000.  mov rax, 0x60
        0xffffffffff600007      0f05           syscall 
        0xffffffffff600009      c3             ret 

  as we can see this can will call the syscall 0x60 (96) which
  is the "gettimeofday"-syscall

  (if there is a vsyscall region mapped, always analyse the whole 
  region, there can be multiple instructions, distributed over a 
  wide range)

  TODO:
  function addr_to_syscall_nr validates whether this address 
  is permitted. Address must be one of 0xffffffffff600000,
  0xffffffffff600400, 0xffffffffff600800
  
  TODO:
  I would like to mention that currently Linux supports vDSO 
  area. It has the same functionality as vsyscall but the 
  difference is that the localization of it is randomized.


  now, but how we can use this?
  TODO
