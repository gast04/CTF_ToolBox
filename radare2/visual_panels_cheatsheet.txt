the Visual Panels mode of r2 is kind a new mode for the reverse
engineering tool, but the usage is rather hard, here is a short 
cheat sheet...


** General notes:

$$: current seek
shift+(arrow right): disable colors 

reference registers with r:XX to achieve
independency according to x86 and x64


** Navigation:

tab: switch between the panels in clockwise direction
x:   close the current panel

h: shift panel content left
shift+h: shift panel splitter left

l: shift panel content right
shift+l: shift panel splitter right

j: scroll in current panel
shift+j: next panel

k: scroll in current panel 
shift+k: previous panel 

m: open file dialog
shift+m: create new custom panel with name and command



** Sample: 
create a new panel which shows the stack with the
references similar to pxr 20 @ rsp

create a new panel with shift+m and the command
is "pxr 180@r:SP" this will print 180 bytes of the
stack according to the binary architecture and with 
references
