with pwntools and gdb it is possible to attach to a created process
proc = pwn.process("binaryname")

I got the problem that it will not open a new terminal per default so 
I had to do a work around. 

add: context.terminal = ['tmux', '-f'] 
to the exploit python script

copy the link/line after the python script execution, it looks like:
  /usr/bin/gdb -q  "/home/niku/Documents/CTFs_H4XXOR/CTFs/Defcon_Qual_2017/smashme" 9468 -x "/tmp/pwnNFeuoG.gdb"
and start it in a new terminal with: tmux -c 'line'
it's important to put it in single quotes.

Note:
the process starts directly after the creation and will halt only at commands
which require user input, so a gdb script with the breakpoint "b main" is 
useless, the gdb will enter at the fgets(or similar) command and never reach the
breakpoint at the main function.

It is also important to enter proc.interactive() at the end because otherwise it
is possible that the process ends which the gdb wants to attach.
