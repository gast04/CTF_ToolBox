# connect with gdb(pwndbg)

  set endian little
  set architecture arm
  target remote:1234

# connect with radare2
r2 -a arm -b 32 -d gdb://127.0.0.1:1234

# my last experience: 27.2.2019
wasn't super good, I dont know where the output is going, 
couldn't redirect with a profile
and r2 cannot really analyze the code provided by qemu-arm but I can debug

# compile and run ARM-binariesi (dynamic linked)
arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc test.c 
qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi a.out

# compile and run ARM-binariesi (static linked)
arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc -static test.c 
qemu-arm a.out

# could debug statically and dynamically linked binaries
