ENUMs:

To show enum types in Pseudocode view:
https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/14795/how-to-add-standard-symbolic-constants-with-bitwise-operators-like-ors

add a enum entry based on an already existing type
delete the last weird entry with a high number
if one entry contains a zero, IDA will complain too, you have to delete
that value!

convert enum to bitfield and than you are fine


Create Struct like C-Structs:

View->Open Subviews->Local Types
right click and insert
after you entered your entered your struct, double click on it



Debugging with IDA like in r2:

use IDApython to read current values
'''
import idc
idc.get_reg_value("RAX")
'''

read arbitrary memory:
'''
import idaapi, idc
idaapi.get_byte(addr)
idaapi.get_bytes(addr, size)
'''

Searching: 
* sequence of bytes

"EC7641" is NOT the same as "EC 76 41"

take care of that
